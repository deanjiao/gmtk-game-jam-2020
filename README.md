Welcome to Potion Panic!

Synopsis: It's time to brew a potion! The headmaster isn't around, but luckily you've been given the recipe! What could possibly go wrong?

Controls: Click and drag

POV: First-person

Out of Control: Ingredients can be out of control and explode on you if you don't keep up. 

Gameplay: Follow the recipe to make the potion. Things will go wrong along the way: you may have to clean up the messes or start over and try again. Good luck!
